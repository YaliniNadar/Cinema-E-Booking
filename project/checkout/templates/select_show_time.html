  In “DC League of Super-Pets,” Krypto the Super-Dog and Superman are
  inseparable best friends, sharing the same superpowers and fighting crime in
  Metropolis side by side. When Superman and the rest of the Justice League are
  kidnapped, Krypto must convince a rag-tag shelter pack—Ace the hound, PB the
  potbellied pig, Merton the turtle and Chip the squirrel—to master their own
  newfound powers and help him rescue the superheroes.
